# TARP Advanced IDS/IPS System
Traffic Analysis and Response Platform
## We respond to MD5's mission to...

## Prepare ![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meadej/SocInABox/master/pres/prepare.PNG "prepare.png")
TARP utilizes open-source data about existing risks in addition to our analysis of new ones to be prepared for both known 
and unknown threats. 

## Detect ![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meadej/SocInABox/master/pres/detect.PNG "detect.png")
Our system uses a hybrid of static analysis and machine learning algorithims in order to keep a constantly updated watch over 
the data traversing into and out of the network. 

## Respond ![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meadej/SocInABox/master/pres/respond.PNG "respond.png")
Based on data received from our analysis platform, TARP will implement intelligent firewall rules in-between
the system and the external web. It will also notify the user when anamolies are detected, allowing enterprise
users to diagnose and resolve the problem using their own personnel and resources. 

## System Summary

## What makes TARP different
* Dozens of commercially available IDS/IPS systems already use machine learning for malware analysis. TARP still utilizes the latest groundbreaking
achievements in machine learning, but diverges from the norm by also incorporating static analysis of packet contents. This hardens our IoT networks against existing threats as well as new ones. 
* TARP dynamically determines the country of origin for each device based on hardware data, allowing us to determine regions of the world
we could normally expect devices to be contacting for updates, etc.
